          mononymously as Eunbi, is a South Korean singer and actress. She

          the survival show Produce 48, finishing in seventh place, which

          Kwon Eun-bi was born on September 27, 1995, in Geumcheon-gu, Seoul.
          Her family consists of her parents and an older brother. She
          attended Dong-il Middle School and graduated from School of
          Performing Arts Seoul. In middle school, she expressed to her
          parents her desire to attend a dance academy. Her parents were
          initially against her becoming a singer, and told her to attend a
          dance academy only as a hobby, wanting her to focus on her studies
          instead. Determined to become a singer, she finally persuaded her
          parents by sending a letter to her other family members, asking for
          help in convincing her parents to let her attend an arts high
          school.
